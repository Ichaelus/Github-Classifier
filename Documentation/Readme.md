# The Documentation

As this project grew, it has been split into more and more encapulated modules and environments. In order to keep things understandable as well for the outside, we wrote a couple of documentation and guideline files. What they contain can be foiund in the following table:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr><th>File</th><th>Contents</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>API.md</td>
	<td>Describes the communication with the PHP backend server and its services as well as a draft of the database structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Appendix B.md</td>
	<td>A list of repository URLs used to test our application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Classification Ambiguities.md</td>
	<td>Generalized classification decisions in unclear situations. Samples classified manually must match these criteria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Classification Guidelines.md</td>
	<td>General description with examples of how classes should be interpreted. Given by the contest description.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Documentation.md</td>
	<td>A comprehensive description of our approaches, goals, discussions, architecture, model and evaluation. This is considered as the `main` documentation file and should clarify most of your questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Frontend Manual.md</td>
	<td>A quick guide on how to interact with our User Interface. This includes both training and testing classification modules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Installation Manual.md</td>
	<td>A list of dependencies needed by our system in order to run on your machine together with instruction on how to install them. Alternative solutions are being given as well if you do not want to install a bunch of libraries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>List of corner cases.md</td>
	<td>This list has no explanatory purpose but is used to create a consensus on how to classify corner cases.</td>
</tr>
